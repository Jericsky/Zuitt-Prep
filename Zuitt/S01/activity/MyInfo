I am Christian Jeric Santos, 23 years old. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics with specialization in Computer Science. A simple person who is willing to sacrifice for a better future.
I would describe myself as a happy, confident, and determined person who is a very fast learner and always hungry to learn and improve. I have the ability when it comes to problem-solving and multitasking which I believe is one of the key factors to succeed with this posion.
Iâ€™m interested in all things related to technology and digital innovation. I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills to become a valuable asset in the IT industry.
